# 0.11 (TBD)

* Packaging / infrastructure improvements:
  * [npm package `kaitai-struct-compiler`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/kaitai-struct-compiler/) now returns the compiler object itself instead of a constructor function (called `KaitaiStructCompiler`). Make sure to adapt your code: replace `(new KaitaiStructCompiler()).compile(...)` with `KaitaiStructCompiler.compile(...)` ([#222](https://github.com/kaitai-io/kaitai_struct_compiler/pull/222))

# 0.10 (2022-07-08)

* General compilation improvements:
  * Prevent referring to non-existent enum members as <code>my_enum::~~unknown_member~~</code> ([8dcd1be](https://github.com/kaitai-io/kaitai_struct_compiler/commit/8dcd1be8ee2dd87b7637a2d01b0bf65e1c2e932f))
  * Prevent duplicate member names in enum definition ([1cbaff9](https://github.com/kaitai-io/kaitai_struct_compiler/commit/1cbaff9be2a1fd6b9b2196e46be7c96ac4f87290)) - they're incompatible with the concept of enum in all target languages
  * Ensure that IDs of `params` are unique and don't collide with `seq` fields or `instances` within a type ([#923](https://github.com/kaitai-io/kaitai_struct/issues/923))
  * Allow whitespace in type invocation: even `type: ' nested :: type ( 1 + 2 , data ) '` now works ([#792](https://github.com/kaitai-io/kaitai_struct/issues/792))
  * Add style warnings reporting non-standard names for size fields (should use `len_` + subject) and repeat count fields (should use `num_` + subject) - see [style guide](https://doc.kaitai.io/ksy_style_guide.html#attr-id)
    * they are only recommendations and don't prevent compilation
    * only available in the command-line `kaitai-struct-compiler` on the JVM platform (not in the Web IDE or in the JavaScript build [at npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/kaitai-struct-compiler))
  * Add the ability to report multiple problems at once instead of stopping after the first error - used for "type validation" errors and style warnings for now (only on JVM compiler builds, not JS builds)
  * Improve readability of problems listed in the compiler output
  * Force UTF-8 as output encoding in generated files (don't rely on system defaults)
  * `--ksc-json-output`: add `warnings` at the same level as `errors`, don't use octal escapes (e.g. "~~`\274`~~" &xrarr; "`\u00bc`") in string values (invalid in JSON)
  * Use SnakeYAML (the YAML parser used by JVM compiler builds) ~~1.25~~ &xrarr; 1.28, which no longer contains the DoS vulnerability allowing a "billion laughs" attack ([50f80d7](https://github.com/kaitai-io/kaitai_struct_compiler/commit/50f80d7eca36983ca0b7f354d12656ec62e639eb))
* Runtime API changes:
  * C++: `kstream::to_string` now works for all integer types up to 64 bits (not just `int` as before), has better performance and portability ([cpp_stl#50](https://github.com/kaitai-io/kaitai_struct_cpp_stl_runtime/pull/50))
  * Go: `ReadBitsInt{Be,Le}` now accept the number of bits as ~~`uint8`~~ &xrarr; `int` ([go@a5c5c1e](https://github.com/kaitai-io/kaitai_struct_go_runtime/commit/a5c5c1e1a7b653b2b569eaf67f27bfa4acf5df2d))
  * Java: `readBytesTerm`, `processXor` now accept a single byte value as ~~`int`~~ &xrarr; `byte`
  * JavaScript: update UMD envelopes to support Web Workers and modules (in the runtime library, generated parsers and JS compiler builds)
  * JavaScript: `readBitsInt{Be,Le}` now throw ~~`Error`~~ &xrarr; `RangeError` when trying to read more than 32 bits
  * Lua: add [zzlib](https://github.com/zerkman/zzlib) as a submodule to support `process: zlib`
  * Python: validation errors now extend ~~`BaseException`~~ &xrarr; `Exception` for easier catching ([python#53](https://github.com/kaitai-io/kaitai_struct_python_runtime/pull/53))
  * Python: add `API_VERSION` tuple used by generated modules to check their compatibility with the runtime library ([python#49](https://github.com/kaitai-io/kaitai_struct_python_runtime/pull/49))
* Notable improvements:
  * Make methods `read_bits_int_{be,le}` for reading [bit integers](https://doc.kaitai.io/user_guide.html#_bit_sized_integers) reliable (fix all bugs) and faster ([#949](https://github.com/kaitai-io/kaitai_struct/issues/949))
  * No longer preallocating arrays to the capacity of `repeat-expr` entries, which could cause excessive memory allocations in invalid files ([f5fe28e](https://github.com/kaitai-io/kaitai_struct_compiler/commit/f5fe28e90ab43a3f6c707b2abe3e14de130ff13e))
  * Fix `valid` (and `contents`) on unnamed `seq` fields (for `contents`, this was a 0.9 regression: [#825](https://github.com/kaitai-io/kaitai_struct/issues/825))
  * Construct: add support for enums
  * Go: implement `encoding: UTF-16{BE,LE}`
  * Go, Lua: implement `valid/expr` ([#435](https://github.com/kaitai-io/kaitai_struct/issues/435))
  * Java: fix broken parse `instances` on Java 7 and 8 when using prebuilt `io.kaitai:kaitai-struct-runtime:0.9` [from Maven Central](https://search.maven.org/artifact/io.kaitai/kaitai-struct-runtime/0.9/jar) ([java#34](https://github.com/kaitai-io/kaitai_struct_java_runtime/issues/34))
  * Java: fix `terminator` values from `0x80` to `0xff` ([java#35](https://github.com/kaitai-io/kaitai_struct_java_runtime/issues/35))
  * Lua: map 1-bit `type: b1` to boolean to match Kaitai Struct design (see [docs](https://doc.kaitai.io/user_guide.html#_basic_data_types))
  * Lua: fix undecided calculated endianness incorrectly treated as big-endian
  * Lua: implement `process: zlib` (see [Installation](https://github.com/kaitai-io/kaitai_struct_lua_runtime#installation) section of Lua runtime for how to enable `zlib` support)
  * Nim: fix `encoding: ASCII` on Windows ([#960](https://github.com/kaitai-io/kaitai_struct/issues/960))
  * Perl: fix array literals, implement all byte array operations, `substring` and `str.to_i(2)` methods
  * PHP: support PHP 8 ([php#8](https://github.com/kaitai-io/kaitai_struct_php_runtime/issues/8))
  * Python: generated parsers no longer import `pkg_resources`, which caused performance and usability issues ([#804](https://github.com/kaitai-io/kaitai_struct/issues/804)) - the runtime library API version check now compares tuples instead
  * Python: `read_bytes` checks if a large read request (8 MiB or more) can be satisfied, even before any bytes are read ([python#61](https://github.com/kaitai-io/kaitai_struct_python_runtime/issues/61))
  * Ruby: validation error messages now display byte arrays as hex dumps, similar to Java ([ruby#4](https://github.com/kaitai-io/kaitai_struct_ruby_runtime/issues/4))
  * (Java - already in 0.9), Lua, PHP: fix translation of unsigned 64-bit integer literals - i.e. from `2**63 = 0x8000_0000_0000_0000` to `2**64 - 1 = 0xffff_ffff_ffff_ffff` ([fd7f308](https://github.com/kaitai-io/kaitai_struct_compiler/commit/fd7f308c67e8eacee98a647bbbbfb2792505bc64), Lua: [#837](https://github.com/kaitai-io/kaitai_struct/issues/837))
    * these languages don't have actual 64-bit unsigned integers, but they do have 64-bit *signed* integers, so the result will be negative, but all 64 bits of precision will be preserved
  * Fix translation of integer `-2**63 = -0x8000_0000_0000_0000` ([e33828a](https://github.com/kaitai-io/kaitai_struct_compiler/commit/e33828a6d2dd7f41ed246f0bf80a3097d8f5c95e))
* Generated code style improvements:
  * Go: change header comment to match Go conventions for generated sources ([#847](https://github.com/kaitai-io/kaitai_struct/issues/847))
  * Lua: fix broken indentation after a `repeat: until` field
  * Python: simpler `return` statements in instance getters
* Infrastructure updates:
  * Bintray was sunset on 2021-05-02: move stable compiler artifacts to GitHub Releases [in the kaitai_struct_compiler repo](https://github.com/kaitai-io/kaitai_struct_compiler/releases)
  * [Web IDE](https://ide.kaitai.io/): improve error reporting (no more useless stack traces)
  * <https://formats.kaitai.io/>: add pointers to runtime installation ([#571](https://github.com/kaitai-io/kaitai_struct/issues/571))
  * <https://ci.kaitai.io/>: group columns by language for better usability ([#823](https://github.com/kaitai-io/kaitai_struct/issues/823))

# 0.9 (2020-10-16)

* New targets support:
  * Python with [Construct](https://construct.readthedocs.io) library
  * HTML - intended for documentation, preliminary support
  * Nim - entry-level support (51% tests pass score)
* New KSY language features:
  * `doc-ref` supports list of references ([#269](https://github.com/kaitai-io/kaitai_struct/issues/269))
  * `meta/tags` allows specification of multiple tags to allow better navigation in the format gallery ([#572](https://github.com/kaitai-io/kaitai_struct/issues/572))
  * Allow accessing nested types using `::` syntax: `foo::bar` ([#275](https://github.com/kaitai-io/kaitai_struct/issues/275))
  * Implement parsed data validations using `valid` key ([#435](https://github.com/kaitai-io/kaitai_struct/issues/435))
  * Implement compile-time `sizeof` and `bitsizeof` operators ([#84](https://github.com/kaitai-io/kaitai_struct/issues/84))
    * Type-based: `sizeof<u4>`, `bitsizeof<b13>`, `sizeof<user_type>`
    * Value-based: `file_header._sizeof`, `flags._bitsizeof` (`file_header`, `flags` are fields defined in the current type)
  * Implement little-endian bit-sized integers ([docs](https://doc.kaitai.io/user_guide.html#bit-ints-le))
    * Support choosing endianness using `le` / `be` suffix: `type: b12le`, `type: b1be`
    * Add `meta/bit-endian` key for selecting default bit endianness (`le` / `be`)
* Expression language:
  * Forced byte array and true array literals ([#371](https://github.com/kaitai-io/kaitai_struct/issues/371)) and
    empty typed array literals ([#372](https://github.com/kaitai-io/kaitai_struct/issues/372))
  * New methods:
    * byte arrays: `length`
  * Allow pure types for type casting: `.as<u2>`, `.as<str>` ([#463](https://github.com/kaitai-io/kaitai_struct/issues/463))
* General compilation improvements:
  * Support Maven-like directory trees by not adding subdir `src` for outputs of Go+Java anymore,
    see [#287](https://github.com/kaitai-io/kaitai_struct/issues/287). While this breaks existing
    builds most likely, it puts those languages in line with all others and adding subdirs is easier
    for the user than removing some added by Kaitai automatically.
  * Better error messages ([#488](https://github.com/kaitai-io/kaitai_struct/issues/488))
  * Support for .ksy files with UTF-8 BOM ([#499](https://github.com/kaitai-io/kaitai_struct/issues/499))
  * Error messages are routed to stderr rather than stdout ([#509](https://github.com/kaitai-io/kaitai_struct/issues/509))
  * `--debug` mode split into `--no-auto-read` and `--read-pos` ([#332](https://github.com/kaitai-io/kaitai_struct/issues/332))
  * C++: add C++11 mode
    * Add `--cpp-standard` CLI option: pass `--cpp-standard 11` to enable C++11 mode (`98` is default)
    * C++11 target:
      * uses `#pragma once` (instead of `#ifndef FOO_H_` header guards)
      * uses `std::unique_ptr<foo>` for owning pointers, raw pointers `foo*` for non-owning
      * supports array literals
  * `--no-auto-read` implemented for C++
  * C++: official Windows and Visual C++ support
  * Fix case conversions to be locale-independent ([#708](https://github.com/kaitai-io/kaitai_struct/issues/708))
* Runtime API changes:
  * Add exceptions `Validation{Not{Equal,AnyOf},{Less,Greater}Than,Expr}Error` inheriting from common ancestor `ValidationFailedError` - thrown on failed validations defined with `valid` or `contents` key ([#435](https://github.com/kaitai-io/kaitai_struct/issues/435))
  * Add method `read_bits_int_le` for parsing little-endian bit-sized integers ([docs](https://doc.kaitai.io/user_guide.html#bit-ints-le))
  * Deprecated classes and methods:
    * ~~`ensure_fixed_contents`~~ &xrarr; explicit `if` that asserts `readBytes(n)` to be equal to the expected `n`-byte array (throwing `ValidationNotEqualError` if it fails)
    * ~~`UnexpectedDataError`~~ &xrarr; `ValidationNotEqualError`
    * ~~`read_bits_int`~~ &xrarr; `read_bits_int_be`
* Major bugfixes:
  * `params/type` - add support for:
    * specific user types
    * `enum` types ([#413](https://github.com/kaitai-io/kaitai_struct/issues/413))
    * byte arrays (`bytes`)
    * arrays (`u2[]`, `struct[]`, etc.)
  * `enum` with undefined values in enum list never crashes a parser ([#523](https://github.com/kaitai-io/kaitai_struct/issues/523) for Python, [#300](https://github.com/kaitai-io/kaitai_struct/issues/300) for Java)
  * Fix coercing different string/bytearray/enum/boolean types (e.g. parsed from stream and created from literal value) in conditional op (`? :`) or array literal
  * Substring `not` cannot be used in expressions ([#556](https://github.com/kaitai-io/kaitai_struct/issues/556))
  * Bit-sized integers were not accounted for properly in `repeat: eos` ([#548](https://github.com/kaitai-io/kaitai_struct/issues/548))
  * Fix switching with else case (`_: foo`) only ([#595](https://github.com/kaitai-io/kaitai_struct/issues/595))
  * C++: fix all known memory leaks
  * C++: fix absolute imports ([#794](https://github.com/kaitai-io/kaitai_struct/issues/794))
  * Java: more consistent closure of underlying IO streams on forced `close()` ([#497](https://github.com/kaitai-io/kaitai_struct/issues/497))
  * Java: fix reading user types in type-switching in `--no-auto-read` mode ([#204](https://github.com/kaitai-io/kaitai_struct/issues/204))
  * Python: work around circular dependencies generation
  * PHP: fix invalid `namespace` declarations when no `--php-namespace` specified ([#637](https://github.com/kaitai-io/kaitai_struct/issues/637))
* Tooling around the compiler updates:
  * Kaitai Struct compiler available [as Maven
    plugin](https://github.com/valery1707/kaitai-maven-plugin) and [as
    Gradle plugin](https://github.com/valery1707/kaitai-gradle-plugin)
* Infrastructure updates:
  * Unstable binary builds are available for all platforms after every CI build at Bintray ([#63](https://github.com/kaitai-io/kaitai_struct/issues/63))
  * KSY language reference replaced with [documentation](https://doc.kaitai.io/ksy_diagram.html) generated from JSON schema
  * https://formats.kaitai.io/ is rebuilt automatically with CI/CD
  * Brand new modular CI/CD system for compiler, underlying
    CI-agnostic, working on multiple different OSes in parallel
    (Linux, Windows, macOS) and showing status at https://ci.kaitai.io/
  * Generate test assertion specs from language-agnostic [KST specs](https://doc.kaitai.io/kst.html)

# 0.8 (2018-02-05)

* New target languages:
  * Lua (96% tests pass score)
  * initial support for Go (15% tests pass score)
* New ksy features:
  * Switchable default endianness: `meta/endian` can now contain a
    switch-like structure (with `switch-on` and `cases`), akin to
    switchable types
    ([docs](http://doc.kaitai.io/user_guide.html#calc-endian)).
  * Parametric user-defined types: one can use `type: my_type(arg1,
    arg2, arg3)` to pass arguments into user type
    ([docs](http://doc.kaitai.io/user_guide.html#param-types)).
  * Custom processing types: one can use `process:
    my_process_name(arg1, arg2, arg3)` to invoke custom processing
    routine, implemented in imperative language
    ([docs](http://doc.kaitai.io/user_guide.html#custom-process)).
  * In repetitions, index of current repetition can be accessed using
    `_index` in expressions
    ([docs](http://doc.kaitai.io/user_guide.html#repeat-index)).
  * Verbose enums: now one can specify documentation and other useful
    information relevant to enums using verbose enum declaration
    format
    ([docs](http://doc.kaitai.io/user_guide.html#verbose-enums)).
  * `meta/xref` key can be used for adding cross-references of a
    format specifications (like relevant RFC entries, Wikidata
    entries, ISO / IEEE / JIS / DIN / GOST standard numbers, PRONOM
    identifiers, etc).
* General compilation improvements:
  * Imports/includes for all languages are now managed properly, no
    duplicate / unnecessary imports should be added
  * Python: basic docstring support
  * More strict ksy precompile checks (less likely to accept ksy that
    will result in non-compilable code), better error messages
* CLI options:
  * Python target now allows to specify package with `--python-package`
  * Java target now allows custom KaitaiStream implementations and
    thus allows to specify default implementation for `fromFile(...)`
    using `--java-from-file-class`.
* Expression language:
  * New methods:
    * floats: `to_i`
    * arrays: `min`, `max`
  * Added byte array comparison
* Packaging / infrastructure improvements:
  * ksc is now available as
    [npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/kaitai-struct-compiler/),
    which now a build dependency of a
    [web IDE](https://ide.kaitai.io/)
* Runtime API changes:
  * C++: now requires `KS_STR_ENCODING_ICONV` or
    `KS_STR_ENCODING_NONE` to be defined to how to handle string
    encodings
  * Java: `KaitaiStream` is now an interface, and there are two
    distinct classes which implement it:
    * `ByteBufferKaitaiStream` provides KaitaiStream backed
      `ByteBuffer` (and thus using memory-mapped files)
    * `RandomAccessFileKaitaiStream` provides KaitaiStream backed by
      `RandomAccessFile` (and thus uses normal OS read calls, as it
      was done in older KaitaiStruct circa v0.5)
  * JavaScript: Error classes are now subclasses of `KaitaiStream` and
    were renamed in the following way: `KaitaiUnexpectedDataError` ->
    `KaitaiStream`.`UnexpectedDataError`
* Major bugfixes:
  * C++: adjusted to made compatible with OS X and Windows MSVC builds
  * Fixed broken generation of byte array literals with high 8-bit set
    in some targets
  * Fixed float literals parsing, fixed larger integer keys YAML parsing
  * Fixed inconsistency of debug mode vs non-debug mode behavior for
    `repeat-*`
  * Fixed chain of relative imports bug: now all relative imports work
    always relative to the file being processed, not to current
    compiler's dir
  * Many problems with switching: invalid common type inferring,
    invalid code being generated, added failsafe `if`-based
    implementations for languages which do not support switching over
    all possible types.
  * Fixed most memory leaks in C++ (only exception-related leaks are
    left now)

# 0.7 (2017-03-22)

* New ksy features:
  * Type importing system: `meta/imports` can be used to import other
    types as first-class citizens in current compilation unit; "opaque
    types" are now disabled by default (see below)
  * Byte-terminated notation (`terminator`, `include` and `consume`)
    can be now used not only for strings, but also for any byte types
    and user types
  * `pad-right` to remove declare excess right padding (usually with
    0s)
  * User types can now use `parent: expression` to enforce a specific
    parent for an object, or `parent: false` to disable parenting at
    all (and, subsequently, remove it from parent type inferring
    process)
  * Type inferring: value instances are now allowed to use `_parent`
  * `doc-ref` to add references to external documentation for types /
    attributes
* Improved compilation process:
  * Compilation is now clearly separated in 3 phases: YAML parsing,
    precompilation, compilation. Phases 1 and 2 are language-agnostic
    and "precompilation" now does all possible sanity checks
    preliminary, making sure that language-specific "compilation"
    doesn't have to deal with invalid data.
  * Improved compilation results reporting: now all error messages
    reported by compiler have file / code location and proper
    user-readable text. Added more than 50 tests for erroneous input
    files. Exceptions thrown directly are considered a compiler bug
    from now on.
  * Generated code now checks for runtime library version
    compatibility and fails to compile / run with non-compliant
    runtime
* Command-line compiler options:
  * `--opaque-types=true` to enable opaque types (disabled by default,
    i.e. using unknown type would be treated as error)
  * `--verbose` now allows fine-tuned verbose logging for various
    compiler's subsystems; using `--verbose=all` exposes a lot of
    internal logic.
  * `--ksc-json-output` to dump compilation results in
    machine-readable JSON format (simplifies ksc integration in other
    tools, like visualizers)
* Console visualizer: faster loading, automatic handling of imports
  (no more need to specify all .ksy files manually on invocation)
* Expression language:
  * Two string types: single quotes (verbatim), double quotes
    (interpolating with escape characters)
  * New type casting operator: `.as<foo>`
  * New methods:
    * arrays: `size`
    * booleans: `to_i`
    * byte arrays: `to_s(encoding)`
    * enums: `to_i`
    * strings: `reverse`
* Runtime API changes:
  * All bytearray to string functions are named `bytes_to_str` in all
    languages
  * Added `read_bytes_term` (akin to what `read_str_term` did
    previously to strings)
  * Removed `read_str_*` methods, they are to be replaced now with
    combination of `read_bytes_*` + `bytes_to_str`
  * Added `bytes_strip_right` and `bytes_terminate`
  * Perl module now uses `IO::KaitaiStruct` package name (instead of
    `Kaitai`)
* Major bugfixes:
  * Recursive top-level types
  * Unaligned bits reading with enums on top of bit-level integers
  * `repeat-until` handling with substreams

# 0.6 (2017-02-04)

* Unaligned bit parsing support
  * Use `type: b12` to parse 12 bits as integer from a stream (obviously, one can use `b1`, `b2`, `b3`, etc)
  * `b1` is parsed as a boolean value
  * If several `bXX` are chained in a sequence, can be used to parse bit masks/fields
  * Using of regular types (i.e. `u1`, `s4`, `str`, etc) starts parsing normally, aligning to next byte
* More meta information, documentation and non-standard keys usage:
  * `doc` for docstrings is allowed on type level
  * `meta` can now include:
    * `title` (to give proper full title for type)
    * `license` (to specify work licensing)
    * `ks-version` (to specify minimal version of Kaitai Struct compiler that must be used to process a .ksy - i.e. `0.6`)
    * `ks-debug` (to enforce generation of classes as if `--debug` mode was specified in command line)
  * `meta` is non-global now, but can be used on multiple levels and inherited from closest one
  * Non-(yet)-standard keys can be used everywhere now using `-key` syntax: for example, Web IDE uses `-webide-representation` key which is ignored by the compiler, but useful for clearer debugging
* Enums are proper first-class citizens now: `enum: XXX` specifications are not just strings, but proper references to declared enums, thus they're checked for validity, can reference upper level nested enums from lower levels, etc - this fixes majority of existing enum namespacing problems in JavaScript, Python, PHP and Perl
* `id` in `seq` elements in now optional: it can be useful for quick exploration mapping (one can always assign identifiers later), or for unused ("reserved for later use") attributes - such attributes would be assigned numbered IDs automatically
* Allow value instances to use `if` and `enum`
* Proper support for "opaque" external types: one can use an undeclared data type, it's expected to be declared in some other .ksy file and it will be properly imported/included in current file
* Expression language:
  * Support for integer literals with underscores for readability: one can use stuff like `123_456_789` or `0b0101_0011` now
  * `to_s` method for integer types to convert them to strings
* Language-specific improvements:
  * C++: clearly separated "null" (no result, for example, due to failed `if` condition) and "not yet calculated" results - introduced `_is_null_XXX()` method for check for true null result in generated API
  * JavaScript: generated enums can be queried for both ID => name and name => ID
  * PHP: dropped type generation for now due to nullable types - one day they might return strictly for PHP 7.1+
  * GraphViz: major compatibility fixes, diagram readability improvements, support for switch types
* Runtime API changes:
  * `ensure_fixed_contents` no longer requires both expected byte array and its length, only array is required
  * Java: all methods no longer use checked exceptions, i.e. `IOException`
* Bugfixes:
  * Type derivation of parent types when using switched `type`, array types, and type combining on switching / ternary operators
  * Multiple translator fixes: type derivation, parenthesis generation
  * Assorted code generation bugfixes in C++, Python, Ruby
* Refactorings and optimizations:
  * Type derivation engine
  * Parse instances use more optimal order of conditionals / debug / IO management applications
  * Improved error messages

# 0.5 (2016-11-09)

* Target languages support:
  * C++/STL - fully supported, all tests pass
  * Python - made compiled code and runtime compatible with both Python 2 and 3, enforced by CI
  * PHP7 - new target language, 98% supported
  * Perl - new target language, 85% supported
  * Graphviz - allows generation of visual diagrams of data formats, to be laid out with GraphViz (`.dot` format)
* New KSY language features:
  * Switch-like conditional structure to determine `type` based on value of expression (instead of tons of `if`s)
  * Attribute field `doc` to annotate fields - will generate docstrings relevant to language (i.e. JavaDoc, JSDoc, YARD/RDoc, etc)
  * `repeat-until` allows repetition of a field until a condition is met
  * Boolean type support
* Expression language:
  * `_io.eof` returns boolean value - whether the end of stream was reached or not
  * `_io.pos` returns current position in the stream
  * `_io.size` returns size of the stream
* .ksy parsing improvements:
  * New unified type derivation engine allows compile-time type error checks and full support of target languages which require absolute type designations (like C++, Python, Perl or PHP)
  * Same YAML parsing code is now used for both JVM and JS platforms
  * Stricter checks on all parsing stages: lots of invalid combinations are now prohibited (instead of choosing one of variants)
  * Better error messages: now in most cases compiler clearly indicates source of the problem
* Build and release process:
  * Compiler: added building as pom module
  * Java runtime: added building as pom module
  * Python runtime: added building as pip module
  * Windows CI: now all commits are built also on Windows, with [.msi package available for download](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/GreyCat/kaitai-struct/build/artifacts)
* Debug mode:
  * Support implemented for Java and JavaScript (to allow creation of visualizer tools in these languages - see [Java GUI for Kaitai Struct](https://github.com/kaitai-io/kaitai_struct_gui) and [Web IDE for Kaitai Struct](https://github.com/koczkatamas/kaitai_struct_webide)
  * Added generation of `SEQ_FIELDS` helper const array that allows clear separation of sequence attributes vs instance without guesswork
  * Exception in debug mode now tries to save as much parsed data as possible (to aid diagnosing the error)
* Incompatible changes:
  * Identifiers are now strictly checked to conform to `lower_underscore_case` pattern (that would be converted to language-specific style on ouput)
  * Java:
    * `_parse` method renamed to `_read`
    * `process*` methods are now static
  * JavaScript: `position` in runtime is renamed to `pos` (to conform to general KS API spec)
  * Compiler API: now all compilers accept unified `RuntimeConfig` for configuration instead of individual options
* Bugfixes:
  * Java:
    * having `if` on a sequence attribute now makes it automatically boxed (to allow it to be `null`)
    * work around some `int` vs `long` incompatibilities
    * proper boxing of floating types
  * Integer modulo (`%`) operation now behaves exactly the same in all languages, always returning positive result (as opposed to remainder operation `%` in languages like C++ or Java)

# 0.4 (2016-08-09)

* Languages support:
  * New target language, fully supported: C# (modules should be usable all across the .NET platform, i.e. from C++/CLI, VB.NET, F#, etc.)
  * Preliminary support for C++ (with STL containers / IO implementation) - note that not all features are implemented.
* Data types:
  * Floating point data types support (available as `f4` and `f8` for single and double precision IEEE754 floats)
  * Separate data type for byte arrays (including support for literal byte arrays)
* Expressions language:
  * Added new testing framework for expression translators
  * Added `.first` and `.last` for arrays (getting first and last element of array)
  * Added `.to_i` for strings (string -> int conversion)
  * Support for accessing `_io` object (IO stream) to access current stream's size (`_io.size`)
* Processing: extended "xor" processing to support XORing with multi-byte keys
* Runtime libraries:
  * Lots of cleanup - now all libraries try to follow the same strict standard (with method naming, parameters, order of methods, etc).
  * JavaScript: implemented full streaming API (both signed & unsigned integer, ensuring fixed contents fields, approximated 64-bit integers, etc).

# 0.3 (2016-04-21)

* New process: "ror/rol" (for simple circular bit shift)
* Ruby: runtime classes reside in a proper namespace: `Kaitai::Struct::Struct` and `Kaitai::Struct::Stream`, now just `KaitaiStruct` and `KaitaiStream`
* Scala.js build: fully implemented, now compiler can be called on a web page as a JavaScript library
* Implemented `process: ` for pre-processing input buffer of user types
* Translator: allow coercing of different int types into each other
* General code cleanup

# 0.2 (2016-04-06)

* Initial public release
