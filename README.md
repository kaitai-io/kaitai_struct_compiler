# Kaitai Struct: compiler

This project is an official reference compiler for [Kaitai Struct](http://kaitai.io) project.

Kaitai Struct is a declarative language used to describe various
binary data structures, laid out in files or in memory: i.e. binary
file formats, network stream packet formats, etc.

The main idea is that a particular format is described in Kaitai
Struct language (`.ksy` files) only once and then can be compiled with
this compiler into source files in one of the supported programming
languages. These modules will include the generated code for a parser
that can read described data structure from a file / stream and give
access to it in a nice, easy-to-comprehend API.

## Further information

If you're looking for information on:

* Kaitai Struct language itself (`.ksy` files, general usage patterns)
  — refer to the [user guide](http://doc.kaitai.io/user_guide.html).
* How to download and install Kaitai Struct — see the
  [downloads](http://kaitai.io/#download).
* How to build the compiler, run the test suite, and join the
  development — see the [developer memo](http://doc.kaitai.io/developers.html).

Note that these clauses only apply only to compiler itself, not `.ksy`
input files that one supplies in normal process of compilation, nor to
compiler's output files — that consitutes normal usage process and you
obviously keep copyright to both.
